Student Feedback Analysis using Python
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback data to evaluate teaching effectiveness, course structure, assignment difficulty, and overall student satisfaction.

Using Python, the project converts raw feedback ratings into meaningful insights that can support data-driven improvements in educational settings.

Objective : 

The main objective of this project is to:

Assess overall course and teaching quality.

Identify strengths and areas for improvement.

Understand factors influencing course recommendation.

Demonstrate end-to-end data analytics skills using Python.

Dataset Description :

Each row in the dataset represents feedback from an individual student.
Columns Included:
Student ID – Unique identifier for students
Well versed with the subject
Explains concepts in an understandable way
Use of presentations
Degree of difficulty of assignments
Solves doubts willingly
Structuring of the course
Provides support for students going above and beyond
Course recommendation based on relevance

All feedback parameters are rated on a numerical scale (e.g., 1–5).

Tools & Technologies :
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning
Matplotlib – Basic visualizations
Seaborn – Statistical visualizations

Key Analysis Performed :

Data loading and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Calculation of average ratings and overall satisfaction score
Comparison of teaching quality vs assignment difficulty
Distribution analysis to understand consistency of student opinions
Correlation analysis to identify factors influencing course recommendation
 
Visualizations Included :

Average rating by feedback parameter (Bar Chart)
Overall satisfaction score (KPI-style metric)
Rating distribution (Boxplots / Histograms)
Teaching clarity vs assignment difficulty comparison
Course recommendation distribution
Correlation heatmap of feedback parameters

Key Insights :

Teaching clarity and subject knowledge received consistently high ratings.
Student support and doubt-solving significantly impact satisfaction levels.
Assignments are perceived as relatively challenging compared to teaching clarity.
Course recommendation is strongly influenced by teaching quality and instructor support.
